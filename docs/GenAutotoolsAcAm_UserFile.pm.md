# NAME

GenAutotoolsAcAm\_UserFile.pm -- Define templates and key-value pairs for use with "gen\_autotools\_acam.pl".

# SYNOPSIS

Loading method example:

    use lib './tools';    # Add the package location to @INC
    use GenAutotoolsAcAm_UserFile;

# DESCRIPTION

This package serves as a user-editable configuration for "gen\_autotools\_acam.pl".
It defines:

- Key-value pairs (placeholders such as `$MY_SCRIPTS$`)
- File templates (e.g. `configure.ac`, `Makefile.am`)

The script replaces the placeholders in each template with the values defined here,
and outputs the resulting files.

# FUNCTIONS

- **getKeyValue()**

    Return the hash of key-value pairs.

- **getTemplates()**

    Return the hash of template file definitions.

- **setupValue()**

    Populate dynamic values (e.g. test names, documentation file lists) based on existing keys.
