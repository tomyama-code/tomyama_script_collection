# NAME

FILL - Generates row-wise data according to a pattern, similar to Excel's AutoFill

# SYNOPSIS

$ fill \[_OPTIONS..._\] _PATTERN..._

# DESCRIPTION

The "**fill**" script generates sequences of numbers or strings according to the specified _PATTERN_.

Each _PATTERN_ can be:

- A single sequence argument, e.g. "001:1" or "1000:-10".
- Multiple patterns simultaneously, either as separate arguments or embedded in a string.
- Embedded numeric sequences using "%%_initial\_value_:_increment_%%" syntax within a string.
- Insertion of STDIN lines at a specific location using "-" or "%%-%%".

Examples:

    # Single numeric sequence
    $ fill 001:1
    001
    002
    ...
    009
    010

    # Multiple patterns simultaneously
    $ fill 001:1 ' ' 1000:-10
    001 1000
    002 0990
    ...
    009 0920
    010 0910

    # Embedded sequences in strings
    $ fill 'newname_%%003:-1%%.txt' -3
    newname_003.txt
    newname_002.txt
    newname_001.txt

    # Using STDIN insertion
    $ ls *.mp4 | fill 'mv "' - '" "newname_%%100:-1%%.mp4"'
    mv "fileA.mp4" "newname_100.mp4"
    mv "fileB.mp4" "newname_099.mp4"

Notes:

\- The number of output lines defaults to 10 if no STDIN is provided.
\- When using STDIN, the number of output lines is automatically determined by the number of input lines, unless the _-repeat\_count_ option specifies a smaller value.
\- Sequences are incremented according to the specified step value.
\- "-" or "%%-%%" can be used to specify where input lines from STDIN are inserted.

# OPTIONS

- -d, --debug

    Enable debug output.

- -h, --help

    Display this help message.

- -_N_

    Specify the number of output lines (number of cycles). The default is 10, or the number of lines in STDIN if piped.

- -w \[_wait\_sec_\]

    Insert a delay between each line of output.
    If _wait\_sec_ is omitted, the default is 1 second.

# ADVANCED USAGE

You can create complex patterns combining fixed strings, numeric sequences, and STDIN input:

    $ fill 320:320 x 180:180 , | tr '\n' ' ' | sed 's/, $/\n/'
    320x180, 640x360, 960x540, 1280x720, 1600x900, 1920x1080, 2240x1260, 2560x1440, 2880x1620, 3200x1800

Embedding STDIN input and renaming files:

    $ ls *.mp4 | \
      fill 'mv "%%-%%" "newname_%%100:-1%%.mp4"' | tee rename.sh
    mv "123.mp4" "newname_100.mp4"
    mv "987.mp4" "newname_099.mp4"
    mv "abc.mp4" "newname_098.mp4"

Modifying STDIN input with the _<<SUB<..>%<..>SUB>>_ macro to rename a file:

    $ ls *.mp4 | \
      fill 'mv "%%-%%" "<<SUB<\.([^\.]+)$>%<_%%01:1%%.$1>SUB>>"' | tee rename.sh
    mv "123.mp4" "123_01.mp4"
    mv "987.mp4" "987_02.mp4"
    mv "abc.mp4" "abc_03.mp4"

_<<GSUB<..>%<..>GSUB>>_ macros are global substitutions:

    $ cat /proc/mounts | ./fill '%%1:1%%\t<<GSUB< +>%<\t>GSUB>>'
    1       C:/cygwin64/bin /usr/bin        ntfs    binary,auto     1       1
    2       C:/cygwin64/lib /usr/lib        ntfs    binary,auto     1       1
    3       C:/cygwin64     /       ntfs    binary,auto     1       1
    4       C:      /cygdrive/c     ntfs    binary,posix=0,user,noumount,auto       1       1
    5       D:      /cygdrive/d     unknown binary,posix=0,user,noumount,auto       1       1
    6       F:      /cygdrive/f     exfat   binary,posix=0,user,noumount,auto       1       1

Creating test data from a random byte stream:

    $ dd if=/dev/random of=/dev/stdout bs=1 count=5 2>/dev/null | \
      od -An -tx1 | sed 's/^ //' | tr ' ' '\n' | \
      fill 'echo ' - ' >' - '.dat' | tee create_testdata.sh
    echo 23 >23.dat
    echo 2c >2c.dat
    echo 23 >23.dat
    echo f6 >f6.dat
    echo a7 >a7.dat

3 lines with a 60-second delay (count-up timer):

    $ fill -3 '%%1:1%% minute has passed.\a' -w 60
    1 minute has passed.
    2 minute has passed.
    3 minute has passed.

30 second countdown timer:

    $ fill -30 29:-1 -w && tput bel
    29
    28
    ...
    01
    00

Copies the current script to all directories at the same level:

step 1. Before you run the command, make sure it is correct.

    $ ls -1 .. | fill 'cp -fp "work1.sh" "../' - '/work1.sh"' | grep -v 8ef1
    cp -fp "work1.sh" "../4b24/work1.sh"
    cp -fp "work1.sh" "../b2ac/work1.sh"
    cp -fp "work1.sh" "../dff5/work1.sh"
    cp -fp "work1.sh" "../f631/work1.sh"

step 2. Run the command in the shell.

    $ !! | bash
    ls -1 .. | fill 'cp -fp "work1.sh" "../' - '/work1.sh"' | grep -v 8ef1 | bash

step 3. Check the copied files.

    $ cksum ../*/work1.sh
    3657935767 874 ../4b24/work1.sh
    3657935767 874 ../8ef1/work1.sh
    3657935767 874 ../b2ac/work1.sh
    3657935767 874 ../dff5/work1.sh
    3657935767 874 ../f631/work1.sh
