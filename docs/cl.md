# NAME

CL - CLOCK PROGRAM

# DESCRIPTION

This is a clock script.

A clock script created to act as a Keep-Alive mechanism,
preventing TCP session timeouts during remote work.

## Supports two display modes:

- Normal Mode:

    Displays time in plain text. (default)

- Large Font Mode (`-l`):

    Displays time in large ASCII art, similar to the `banner` command.

## Interactive Commands (during execution):

- `Ctrl` + `C`

    Exit

- `L` + `Enter`

    Switch to Large Font Mode

- `N` + `Enter`

    Switch to Normal Mode

- `INTERVAL` + `Enter`

    Update interval in seconds (1-60)

- `Enter`

    Refresh the display immediately

# SYNOPSIS

$ cl \[_OPTIONS..._\] \[_ARGUMENTS_\]

# OPTIONS

- -l

    Enable Large Font Mode (ASCII art).

- -v, --version

    Display script version, Perl version, and exit.

- -h, --help

    Display simple help and exit.

# ARGUMENTS

- INTERVAL

    Update interval in seconds (1-60). Default is 1.

# DEPENDENCIES

This script uses only **core Perl modules**. No external modules from CPAN are required.

## Core Modules Used

- [constant](https://metacpan.org/pod/constant) — first included in perl 5.004
- [File::Basename](https://metacpan.org/pod/File%3A%3ABasename) — first included in perl 5
- [POSIX](https://metacpan.org/pod/POSIX) — first included in perl 5
- [strict](https://metacpan.org/pod/strict) — first included in perl 5
- [Time::HiRes](https://metacpan.org/pod/Time%3A%3AHiRes) - first included in perl v5.7.3
- [Time::Local](https://metacpan.org/pod/Time%3A%3ALocal) - first included in perl 5
- [warnings](https://metacpan.org/pod/warnings) — first included in perl v5.6.0

## Survey methodology

- 1. Preparation

    Define the script name:

        $ target_script=cl

- 2. Extract used modules

    Generate a list of modules from `use` statements:

        $ grep '^use ' $target_script | sed 's!^use \([^ ;{][^ ;{]*\).*$!\1!' | \
            sort | uniq | tee ${target_script}.uselist

- 3. Check core module status

    Run `corelist` for each module to find the first Perl version it appeared in:

        $ cat ${target_script}.uselist | while read line; do
            corelist $line
          done
