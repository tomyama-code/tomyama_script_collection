# NAME

MARK - emphasizes part matching a pattern

# SYNOPSIS

$ mark \[_OPTIONS..._\] _PATTERN_ \[_FILE..._\]

# DESCRIPTION

The "**mark**" behaves like the marker pen.
The specified _PATTERN_ is searched out and that part is emphasized.

The _PATTERN_ can be described by the Regular-Expression equal with **Perl**.

_FILE_ specifies the input file name.
If it is a standard input, "**-**" is given.

# OPTIONS

- -d, --debug

    Debugging mode is on.

- -f \[_num-forward_\[,_num-rear_\]\]

    It works like a filter program. If you omit the value,
    the default is to display 5 lines before and after.
    If you specify 0 for _num_, only lines that match _PATTERN_ will be displayed.
    If you specify 0, grep is more convenient.

- --help

    Display simple help and exit.

- -h, --no-filename

    Suppress the prefixing of filenames on output when multiple files are searched.

- -H, --with-filename

    Print the filename for each match.

- -i, --ignore-case

    Ignore case distinctions in the _PATTERN_.

- -n, --line-number

    Prefix each line of output with the line number within its input file.

- -c, --force-color

    Enable highlighting even if STDOUT is not a TTY (pipe, redirect).
