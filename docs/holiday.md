# NAME

HOLIDAY - Displaying holiday data in the pager

# DESCRIPTION

Displays the holiday data "cl.holiday" in the pager.

The default pager is the "less" command.
If the $PAGER environment variable is set,
that setting takes precedence.

# SYNOPSIS

$ holiday \[_OPTIONS_\]

# OPTIONS

- -v, --version

    Display script version, Perl version, and exit.

- -h, --help

    Display simple help and exit.

# DEPENDENCIES

This script uses only **core Perl modules**. No external modules from CPAN are required.

## Core Modules Used

- [constant](https://metacpan.org/pod/constant) — first included in perl 5.004
- [File::Basename](https://metacpan.org/pod/File%3A%3ABasename) — first included in perl 5
- [strict](https://metacpan.org/pod/strict) — first included in perl 5
- [warnings](https://metacpan.org/pod/warnings) — first included in perl v5.6.0

## Survey methodology

- 1. Preparation

    Define the script name:

        $ target_script=holiday

- 2. Extract used modules

    Generate a list of modules from `use` statements:

        $ grep '^use ' $target_script | sed 's!^use \([^ ;{][^ ;{]*\).*$!\1!' | \
            sort | uniq | tee ${target_script}.uselist

- 3. Check core module status

    Run `corelist` for each module to find the first Perl version it appeared in:

        $ cat ${target_script}.uselist | while read line; do
            corelist $line
          done
